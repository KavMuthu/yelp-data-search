'A Data Analysis Application' for Yelp.com's business review data.

▪ Developed a data analysis application which runs queries on the Yelp data and extracts useful information for users and businesses.

▪ The dataset (in JSON format) containing information about 45k businesses, 250k users and 1.2m reviews was converted to Oracle database.

▪ Application has a user interface that provides the user the available business categories (main and sub-categories) and the attributes associated with each business category. 

▪ Using this application, the user will search for the businesses from various business categories that have the properties (attributes) the user is looking for. The user can filter the search results by state, city or zip code. The results can also be filtered based on the business open hours and days. The app also allows the user to view the reviews provided for each business.
